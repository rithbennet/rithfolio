Throughout my journey in software engineering, I've struggled with choosing which language to even use.

## Why TypeScript?

Honestly, no particular reason — it's the language I use for most of my work. My first touch with frameworks was Next.js, so I dove right into TypeScript with barely any prior knowledge. Even when coming from JavaScript, I had a lot to learn.

After using TypeScript for a while, I can see the benefits of it over JavaScript. From improved tooling to fewer runtime surprises. More thoughts to come — lemme deploy this first and write tomorrow.
