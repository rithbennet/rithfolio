Welcome to the blog! This is a seed post to verify listing, reading time, tags, and comments.

## Why Contentlayer?

Contentlayer is a content SDK that transforms your content into type-safe JSON data. It works seamlessly with Next.js and provides:

- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types
- **MDX support** - Write content in MDX with custom components
- **Computed fields** - Automatically calculate reading time, slugs, etc.
- **Hot reload** - See changes instantly during development

## Getting Started

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add contentlayer next-contentlayer reading-time
```

Then configure your content schema in `contentlayer.config.ts`:

```typescript
export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  filePathPattern: `posts/**/*.mdx`,
  contentType: "mdx",
  fields: {
    title: { type: "string", required: true },
    date: { type: "date", required: true },
    description: { type: "string", required: true },
  },
}));
```

## Features Included

1. **Auto reading time** - Calculated automatically from content
